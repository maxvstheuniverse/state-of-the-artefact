Make sure python 3.7 or higher is installed and initialize a virtual environment python3 -m venv venv.
Activate the virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate.

Then upgrade pip pip install --upgrade pip and install packages pip install -r requirements.txt.
Finally, initialize the setup using python setup.py build or python setup.py develop.

Then to run use `run` while in the venv.

Use `run --help` to see the parameters.
